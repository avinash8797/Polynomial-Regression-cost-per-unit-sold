Polynomial Regression: Predict Cost per Unit Sold
This project focuses on using Polynomial Regression to predict the cost per unit sold based on various factors. Polynomial regression is a type of regression analysis that models the relationship between independent and dependent variables as an nth-degree polynomial.

.


Analyze the relationship between sales and costs.
Build a Polynomial Regression model to predict costs based on input variables.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
